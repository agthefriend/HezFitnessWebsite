<h1>How Exercise Boosts our Mental Health</h1>
<h2>Often, people who exercise regularly do it simply because it makes them feel good. Exercise can boost your mood, concentration and alertness. It can even help give you a positive outlook on life. The link between exercise and mental health is complicated. Inactivity can be both a cause and a consequence of mental illness
But there are lots of ways that exercise can benefit your mental health, such as:</h2>
<h3>
<ul>
  <li>The levels of chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin, stress hormones and endorphins, change when you exercise.</li>
  <li>Regular exercise can help you sleep better. And good sleep helps you manage your mood.</li>
  <li>Exercise can improve your sense of control, coping ability and self-esteem. People who exercise regularly often report how good achieving a goal makes them feel.</li>
  <li>Exercise can distract you from negative thoughts and provide opportunities to try new experiences.</li>
  <li>It offers an opportunity to socialise and get social support if you exercise with others.</li>
  <li>Exercise increases your energy levels.</li>
  <li>Physical activity can be an outlet for your frustrations.</li>
  <li>Exercise can reduce skeletal muscle tension, which helps you feel more relaxed.</li>
</ul>
