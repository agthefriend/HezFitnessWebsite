<h1>Workout Guide</h1>
<h2>We will be using a 4 week beginners Plan</h2>


<h2>Week 1: Full-body split</h2> 
<h3>means that per day 1 major bodypart per day and rest day after basically Sunday,Tuesday,Thursday and Saturday: Rest
Monday, Wednesday and Friday: Workout
3 sets 8-12 Reps per set preferably 8 Reps for set 1, 10 reps for set 2 and 12 reps for set 3</h3>

<h2>Week 2: Two-day split: Upper body/Lower body</h2>
<h3>two upper-body days (Monday and Thursday) and two lower-body days (Tuesday and Friday), and each bodypart is trained twice. Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday will be your recovery days. Several exercises from Week 1 are carried over to Week 2, but one move is added to each bodypart routine—with the exception of abs.
Same scheme of reps, though in Week 2 you’ll go slightly higher in reps (15) on your third set of each exercise.<h3>

<h2>Week 3: Three-day split: Push/Pull/Legs</h2>
<h3>Day 1: Train all “pushing” bodyparts (chest, shoulders, triceps) Then for Day 2: hit the “pulling” bodyparts (back, biceps) and abs. And Lastly Day 3 work your lower body (quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves). Starting with Monday to Wednesday as Day 1-3 and Thursday to Saturday as Day 1-3 With Sunday as your rest day 
As in Week 2, you train each bodypart twice a week, so you’ll hit the gym six days this week.
<br>
One new exercise is added to each bodypart routine to provide even more angles from which to train your target muscles to promote complete development You’ll hit each muscle group with two exercises of 3–4 sets each four sets for large bodyparts (chest, back, shoulders, quads, hamstrings) and 3 sets for smaller bodyparts (biceps, triceps, abs, calves). The result is 16 total sets for the week for large bodyparts and 12 sets total for smaller ones. Once again, working in the 8–15-rep range<h3>

<h2>Week 4: Four-day split: Full body</h2>
<h3> In the fourth and final week of the program, you’ll train four days in a four-way split that hits each bodypart just once (except for calves and abs, which are each trained twice). Four-day splits are common among experienced lifters because they involve training fewer bodyparts (typically 2–3) per workout, Rep schemes remain and up to five sets per move for larger bodyparts, and even 10 sets of calf raises on Thursday
